\p{Simplicial type theory (STT) was introduced by Riehl and Shulman to
leverage homotopy type theory to prove results about
#{(\infty,1)}-categories. Initial work on simplicial type theory
focused on "formal" arguments in higher category theory and, in
particular, no non-trivial examples of #{\infty}-category theory were
constructible within STT. More recent work has changed this state of
affairs by applying techniques developed initial for cubical type
theory to construct the #{\infty}-category of spaces. We complete this
process by constructing the #{\infty}-category of
#{\infty}-categories, recovering one of the main foundational results
of #{\infty}-category theory (straightening--unstraightening) purely
type-theoretically. We also show how this construction enables new
examples of the directed version of the structure identity principle,
the structure homomorphism principle.}
