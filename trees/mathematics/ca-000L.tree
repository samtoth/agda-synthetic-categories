\p{An ideal #{I} of #{A} is maximal iff the quotient ring #{A/I} is a field.}

\proof{
We want to show that the only ideals of #{A/I} are #{(0)} and #{(1)}.
By the [correspondance theorem](ca-000I), ideals in #{A/I} are just ideals in #{A} that contain #{I}. By the very definition of a maximal ideal, this means that the ideals must be either #{I = 0/I} and #{A}.
