\title{The Op modality}
\author{samueltoth}

\import{stt-macros}

\p{
In \citek{GWB25}, they work in an instantiation of Multimodal Type Theory as developed by
\citek{GratzerThesis}, with a mode theory containing the #{\flat \dashv \sharp} adjunction, as well as two further
modalities #{\frak{op}} and #{\frak{tw}}. In this note we examine the #{\flak{op}} modality and consider if it is possible to
postulate the existence of this modality without modifying the type theory.
}

\p{Firstly, it is an idempotent modality so we have the (strict) law that #{\op \circ \op = id}. It also has a relation to the #{\flat} and #{\sharp} modalities, namely that #{\flat \circ \op = \flat} and #{\sharp \circ \op = \sharp}. In addition op is self adjoint
#{\op \dashv \op}, and so preserves limits, and in particular preserves pullbacks.
}

\p{This means that we can at least safely define the type operator inside of type theory, and state that it commutes with
#{\Sigma} and #{\bb1}. Furthermore we can postulate the idempotency, #{{A^{op}}^{op} \simeq A} and use agda's rewriting rules
to make this equation hold strictly.

\p{Inside the type theory, we can show: #{\modflat{A^{op} \to B} \simeq \modflat{A \to B^{op}}} }
