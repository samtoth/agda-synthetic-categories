\p{We introduce the required background on set quotients, and defines quotient lattices.
   This is a required prerequisite to stating the duality axiom for TTT.
   In order to do this we extend some of the notions in coequalisers, setting up
   a [bi-recursion principle]() for maps out of a pair of coequalisers.
   We define [set quotients](), and prove elimination principles.
   Finally we define the [quotient lattice]() of a lattice by a congruence.}

\p{A detail to note is several induction principles for truncation were marked opaque,
   in order to reduce term size and increase type checking speed.}

\p{The next step for this work is to define presentations, and then finite presentations
   of lattices, and then state the duality axiom.}
