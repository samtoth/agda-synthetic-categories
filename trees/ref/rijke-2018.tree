\p{The study of homotopy theoretic phenomena in the language of type theory is sometimes loosely called `synthetic homotopy theory'. Homotopy theory in type theory is only one of the many aspects of homotopy type theory, which also includes the study of the set theoretic semantics (models of homotopy type theory and univalence in a meta-theory of sets or categories), type theoretic semantics (internal models of homotopy type theory), and computational semantics, as well as the study of various questions in the internal language of homotopy type theory which are not necessarily motivated by homotopy theory, or questions related to the development of formalized libraries of mathematics based on homotopy type theory. This thesis concerns the development of synthetic homotopy theory.}
