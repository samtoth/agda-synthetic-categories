\p{One idiosyncratic framing of type theory is as the study of operations invariant under substitution. Modal type theory, by contrast, concerns the controlled integration of operations—modalities—into type theory which violate this discipline, so-called non-fibered connectives. Modal type theory is therefore built around a fundamental tension: the desire to include modalities and powerful principles for reasoning with them on one hand, and the need to maintain the conveniences and character of Martin-L¨of type theory which stem from substitution invariance.}
