  We investigate the interaction between modal types and identity
types in MTT and emphasize the connection to function extensionality. We
show that the desired “extensionality” principle holds in extensional MTT and
conjecture the same for cubical MTT. Finally, we show that extending MTT
with ‘crisp’ induction principles yields the same extensionality principles in
MTT without disrupting canonicity or normalization.
