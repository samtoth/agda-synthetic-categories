\p{A short note, just to say that the library is now using [Forester 5](https://www.forester-notes.org/011P/index.xml).}

\title{For readers}

\ul{
  \li{There is now an [atom feed](http://samtoth.github.io/agda-synthetic-categories/changelog/atom.xml)
      for this changelog - which I would like to transform into something more like a workblog.}
  \li{All of the in-code links now take you to the right place!}
}
}

\subtree{
\title{For contributers}

\ul{
  \li{We no longer have to write \code{\startverb \meta{defines}{["..."]} \stopverb}
      all over the place - the links work automatically.}
\li{The [[agda-forester]] software is now significantly cleaner.
    The infrastructure that is now in place should make building
some kind of type directed search quite feasable. The first step
towards this would be adding all the agda names to the search bar
in the forest.
   }
\li{There was a pretty fundamental limitation in the way we were generating
metadata before this update which meant that it wasn't possible to have
 multiple modules with the same name (e.g. \code{Data.Bool} and \code{Algebra.Lattic.Bool}) }
}
}

\p{Now this change is out the way, there a few updates in the backlog ready to push out quite quickly.}
