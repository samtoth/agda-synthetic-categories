\title{The Unit Type}

\import{stt-macros}

\p{
The unit type is the terminal object in the category of types, and so usually denoted #{\bb1}. It has a single unique inhabitant. Due to agda having #{\eta}-laws for records, it is strictly unique.
}

% ```agda
\agda{
module foundations.Unit where

open import foundations.universe

record 𝟙 : Type where
  constructor tt

{-# BUILTIN UNIT 𝟙 #-}

}
% ```
