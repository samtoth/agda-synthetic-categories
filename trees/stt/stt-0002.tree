\todo{
This is still in early stages of development so might be easier to write a grand statement once more has been
developed. We set out in the tradition of \citek{HoTT} to develop informal and formal mathematics alongside
each other and to use agda and type theory as internal languages for categories of interest, with a
particular focus on the simplicial type theory originally introduced by \citek{RS17}.
}


\ul{
  \li{Develop the base theory of HoTT in the style of the \citek{HoTT} book, as a common ground
      on top of which we can explore synthetic theories. In doing so, we will make as much use
      of Agda's fetaures as necessary in order to maximalise the ergonomics of the library. i.e.
      type classes, metaprogramming, records, notations, modality etc. We will also use a small
      handful of rewriting rules to e.g. to make eliminators of higher inductive types compute.}

  \li{Develop a robust theory of modalities.
    \ul{
      \li{Defining 'internal' modalities as per \citek{rijkeMod2020}. This will be a crucial
          organisational tool within the libarary, allowing us a single interface through which
	  we can define the subuniverses of #{n}-types, #{\infty}-groupoids/categories and the
	  indescrete modality.}
      \li{Develop the theory around the inbuilt comonadic modality in agda: #{\flat}, establishing
          the adjunction #{\flat \dashv \sharp} which was explored for example in \citek{ShulmanRealCohesive2017}}
    }
  }

\li{Focus on developing synthetic category theory:
  \ul{
  \li{We would like to work inside the classifying #{\infty}-topos of the theory of bounded
      distributive totally ordered lattices, or in other words simplicial spaces. To do so we
      will axiomatise the interval type as the universal bounded distributive lattice and explore
      axioms that can internally reflect the structure of our intended model.}
  \li{Formalise the yoneda-image of the simplex category internally. Including defining n-simplices,
      horns, boundaries and the morphisms between them. In particular trying to create a pleasant
      interface to them - comparitive to the ergonomics of the shape layer in the type theory with
      shapes of Riehl-Shullman, as implemented in the Rzk proof assistant.}
  \li{Formalise notions of #{\infty}-category theory}
  \li{Do some Higher algebra..????}
  \li{Or maybe look into semantics - e.g. higher natural models, higher type theories ala Uemura???}
  \li{profit???}
