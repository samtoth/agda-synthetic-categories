\title{Ideals as kernels}
\taxon{remark}

\p{
Recall that given a diagram of rings:
##{A \xrightarrow{f} B}
We can:
\ol{
  \li{Take the kernel of the underlying group homomorphism, giving us a (normal) subgroup #{\textrm{Ker}(f) \hookrightarrow A}. Notice that when #{f} is a ring homomorphism, #{\textrm{Ker}(f)} is an ideal of #{A}.}
  \li{Take the image of f as a group homomorphism, giving us a subgroup #{\textrm{Im}(f) \hookrightarrow B}. Notice that when #{f} is a ring homomorphism, then #{\textrm{Im}(f)} is a subring of #{B}.}
}

Note that categorically speaking, there is a subtlety here, the category of rings does have images, but because kernels are not subrings, it doesn't have kernels. A general theme here is that the category of rings isn't as nice a category as we would hope, (it isn't [[abelian]]). But, as we will see later, we can move into the category of R modules which is much better behaved.
