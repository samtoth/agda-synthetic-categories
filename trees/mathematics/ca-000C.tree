This data assembles into a [[displayed category]], #{\mathbf{Ring}}, over the category of abelian groups (which is itself displayed over the category of sets).

Although this isn't the traditional presentation of #{\mathbf{Ring}}, this is often how we think about rings, indicated by our free use of coersion from rings and ring homomorphisms into groups and group homomorphisms or sets and functions.
